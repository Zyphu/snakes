# Snakes
## About
This is my take on the classic game Snake. It is an ASCII text-based terminal game featuring a singleplayer and a multiplayer mode that can be played through a local network or the internet. 

## Rules
Grow your snake by eating the food (#) and don't bite yourself or anyone else!
Control the movement of your snake with the arrow keys. 

## Requirements
- Python 3, its curses module, and a terminal

## Execution
```
python snakes.py
```
## Examples

### Single Player
